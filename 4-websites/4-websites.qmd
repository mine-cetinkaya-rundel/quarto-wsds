# Anatomy of a Quarto project

## What defines a Quarto Project?

::: r-fit-text
> [A Quarto Project is a directory]{.fragment} [that contains a file called `_quarto.yml`.]{.fragment}
:::

\

::: columns
::: {.column .fragment .fade-right width="50%"}
This is a Quarto Project.

![](images/quarto-project.png){.drop fig-alt="Files panel in RStudio showing my-doc.qmd and _quarto.yml."}
:::

::: {.column .fragment .fade-left width="50%"}
This is not.

![](images/not-quarto-project.png){.drop fig-alt="Files panel in RStudio showing only my-doc.qmd."}
:::
:::

## \_quarto.yml {auto-animate="true"}

A YAML file with particular keys and values that Quarto recognizes. Unrecognized keys are ignored.

``` {.yaml .fragment filename="_quarto.yml"}
project:
  title: "A Barebones Project"
```

## Quarto Project vs RStudio Project

::: columns
::: {.column .incremental .smaller width="50%"}
-   Quarto Projects determine how `quarto render`, `quarto preview` and `quarto publish` work when run inside the directory.
-   RStudio Projects store configuration info for the IDE when working from the directory.
-   A directory can have one or both!

## Quarto projects

-   Quarto projects have a `_quarto.yml` file

-   The `type` field in this file indicates the type of project:

    -   `default`: Collection of documents

    -   `website`: Websites (and blogs)

    -   `book`: Books

    -   `manuscript`: Manuscripts (Quarto 1.4+)

## Quarto websites

-   Websites are essentially `format: html` + a Quarto Project file

-   But a website is different than `format: html` in that it has multiple pages

-   Websites are our first exploration into Quarto Projects

-   Websites and books are very similar in that they associate multiple pages/resources into a connected resource

## Our turn

::: task
Let's build a website together from all of the documents we've created so far and highlight the following features of Quarto websites:

-   `_quarto.yml`

-   `index.qmd` / landing page

-   Navigation

-   Freeze

-   Publishing to QuartoPub

-   An aspect of the workshop webpage that you fancy?

# Computations

## When should code be re-run? {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   You might have a reason to re-run all code in a Quarto website (every single chunk in every single document) every time you render the website.

-   But, chances are, that's not what you want.

    -   Just playing around styling -- you probably don't want to run the code again

    -   Changed some code in a document -- you probably want to re-run the code in that document, but not necessarily others

    -   Made a big change affecting computations on many or all pages -- you probably want to re-run all code

-   `freeze` and `cache` options give you fine control over these decisions
:::

## Freeze {.smaller}

-   The `freeze` option controls when/if computational documents be re-rendered during a global project render:

``` yaml
execute:
  freeze: true  # never re-render during project render
```

``` yaml
execute:
  freeze: auto  # re-render only when source changes
```

``` yaml
execute:
  freeze: false  # always re-render
```

-   The `freeze` option is typically added to a `_metadata.yml` file within a specific directory, affecting all files in that directory.

-   For blogs, set `feeze` in `_metadata.yml` at the root of the `posts` directory.

-   You can have it only within specific subdirectories for more complex sites.

## Cache

-   Cache stores the results of computations for a specific file.

-   Cache invalidation is triggered by changes in chunk source code (or other cache attributes you've defined).

-   `cache` can also be set at the chunk level. Consider using the cache for computationally expensive chunks.

## Freeze vs. cache {.smaller}

-   Freeze option is typically set

    -   for the whole website in `_quarto.yml`, or

    -   for files within a directory in `_metadata.yml` in that directory

``` yaml
execute: 
  freeze: auto
```

-   Cache option is typically set for a given file or for individual chunk(s) in a file.

``` yaml
execute:
  cache: true
```

or

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| cache: true

1 + 1
```

# Publishing

## QuartoPub

-   [Quarto Pub](https://quartopub.com/) is a free publishing service for content created with Quarto. It is ideal for blogs, course or project websites, books, presentations, and personal hobby sites.

-   Publish with `quarto publish`:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto publish quarto-pub
```

-   Gain a `_publish.yml` that is safe to check into version control.
